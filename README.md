# Caterbuino

Caterbuino is a *Snake*-like game for the
[Gamebuino-META](https://gamebuino.com/) console. You control a Caterpillar eating fruits that appear on the field. Each time the caterpillar eats a fruit, it grows.

The fresher a fruit is, the more the points are gained. After a while, a fruit disappear.

If the caterpillar touches a border of the playfield or itself, the game is over.

The goal is to have the higher score possible.

## Install

You can install the game by either downloading [the ZIP file](http://mokona.puupuu.org/gamebuino/caterbuino.zip) and uncompress its files in a `caterbuino` folder at the root of your Gamebuino-META SD Card.

## Build

To build Caterbuino, clone the repository and open it with the `Arduino IDE`. You can then use `upload` on the IDE. As the game embeds all assets in its code, you don't need any external files for it to run.

Caterbuino is dependant on the Gamebuino-META SDK obsiously, so it must have been installed on your Arduino toolchain. How to do this is available on the [Gamebuino-META](https://gamebuino.com/) official site.
